## 2110211-Data-Structure-Group-Work-Assignment-video

This is a group work for the **Intro to Data Structures** course at Chulalongkorn University.

My friends and I worked on the **Digital Wallet (d66_f1_digital_wallet)** problem from the Grader.

* Work with: Tawan([@Dec-48](https://github.com/Dec-48)), Ham([@Haminic](https://github.com/haminic)), and Boon([@boonpasin](https://github.com/boonpasin)).
  
We wrote the code in **C++** and made a video to explain the problem and concepts of the solution code.
